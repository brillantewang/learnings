# 3/5/18 - Binary

Today I came across a LeetCode problem that required a base understanding of binary. This isn't something that we really covered at App Academy so I did a bit of research and here's my understanding of binary.

## What is it?
A number system with only two unique digits, 0 and 1. In everyday life, we normally use a `base 10` system (also known as a `denary` system). This is because there are ten digits to choose from, 0 up to 9. If we want to go up to the next number, we 'round up' to 10.

Binary on the other hand, is a `base 2` system, meaning it only has two digits to choose from, 0 and 1. That means 0 represents zero, 1 represents one, but if you want two, you'll have to 'round up' to 10.
